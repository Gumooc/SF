Once there are tales
that are told,
a thought game to be,
I'll find our tribe some gold, 
so they'll be happy.
Once I was thinking about gold.

It was a poor tough life.
Our hearts are getting weaker.
Dreaming one day we get the riches
and no more we'll suffer.
For our meals, we're eating seeds or
drinking bitter liquor.
Never rich, 
and some just starve to keep this steady figure.
Once I was dreaming about gold,
my brother told me,
don't go down to the mine,
it will be risky.
Once I was dreaming about gold.

I knew about the mine,
of all the dangers against me.
So I started crafting swords 
prepared to fight the zombies.
An ore that is so shiny,
will always motivate me.
Cause only those that really care
will ever really worry.
Once I was sent to find gold,
my quest was foretold.
I'll go by morning sun
although I'm lonely.
Once I was sent to find gold.

Now onward to my goal,
hope this won't end in failure.
Even though with worst equitment,
I still fear no creeper.
A wooden sword with me,
at least in my favor,
and if I don't make it 
back to home,
I hope they grant me honor.
Once I was mining for gold,
my story got told.
I was taking almost everything 
I saw before me.
Once I was mining for gold.

Soon I'll be holding these gold
past through the stronghold.
I've travelled under the mine
and no more roaming.
Soon I'll be hoarding thes gold.

Time to build up a new life.
Brother is excited to see me.
Now we can make up a new home
and I can tell them stories.
All of my tribe are with me.
Time to fill a life so pretty.
All these tracks that I left behind
maybe rich I feel worried.
Soon we'll be trading this gold.
Walls to protect everyone,
remember life 
and now our life becomes a safer one.
But some mobs felt the envy,
cause the tribe was so poor once.
I hope my village will survive
when the mobs start their hunt.
Soon they'll be stealing our gold,
with their undead hearts so cold,
and we don't have a lot of weapons
for an army.
Soon they'll be stealing our gold.

Soon they'll be stealing our gold,
bodies drop down to the cold,
and I can't save my tribe
from this raid.
I'm so sorry.
Soon they'll stealing our gold

Once I was mining for gold,
a thought game to be,
I'll find our tribe some gold,
so we'll be happy.
Once I was mining for gold.

Once I was mining for gold.
